 		 		 	Happy is a 6-year-old anthropomorphic cat with blue fur. He is Natsu Dragneel's best friend and sole traveling companion at the start of the series. Mashima originally intended to name him after the Norse god Freyr, but found the name did not fit his character. Happy possesses a magic ability called Aera, translates as "Wings" with which he is able to grow white feathered wings and fly at great speeds. He uses this form to carry Natsu in midair, and is the only one Natsu is able to ride without succumbing to motion sickness. He is originally hatched from an egg found by Natsu and Lisanna Strauss, who name him "Happy" after his birth cheers up their guildmates in the middle of a disagreement. Six years later, Happy discovers his origins as an Exceed from Edolas; while there, Happy unknowingly encounters his parents, the farmer couple Lucky  and Marl , whom he is separated from before birth as part of their queen's plan to evacuate 100 unborn children to Earth-land and save them from their realm's destruction. In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Rie Kugimiya. Tia Ballard voices the character in its English dub.
